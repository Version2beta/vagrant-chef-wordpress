# vagrant-chef-wordpress

A shortcut to a Wordpress dev environment on a Vagrant VirtualBox provisioned with Chef. Updated to support Vagrant 2 (1.2) configuration.

## Usage

One: Clone this repository.

```
git clone https://github.com/Version2beta/vagrant-chef-wordpress.git
```

Two: Vagrant up, yo.

```
cd vagrant-chef-wordpress
vagrant up
```

This takes almost six minutes on my laptop. Grab a beer.

Three: Configure your blog at [http://localhost:8000/wp-admin/install.php](http://localhost:8000/wp-admin/install.php).
